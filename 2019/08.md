## .NET Foundation Project Updates
### [Chemistry Add-In for Word (Chem4Word)](https://www.chem4word.co.uk/)

It seems like it's all gone quiet on Chem4Word recently, but we've been working _extremely_ hard on addressing some concerns.  _Chem4Word_ is currently released under the Apache 2.0 license, but its structure 'sketcher' is a 3rd-party product  which uses GPL.  

So we've been writing a new sketcher - the _Advanced CML-based Molecule Editor_ (or ACME for short).  It's written in C# and uses Windows Presentation Foundation for its graphics.  It's can be a drop-in structured editor for any Windows Forms or WPF application.
